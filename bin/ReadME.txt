	Viewer Application

 Simple application to render gpu geometry cache from the MoPLUGS project.

How to use

 First of all, you need to setup system environment variable MOPLUGS_SHADERS and specify a path to the your GLSLFX folder. For example: D:\\Work\\MOPLUGS\\_Plugins\\GLSLFX\\

 Then to open a cache file you have two ways
1) run from the command line and specify a path to the *.xml cache file as a first argument
2) open cache *.xml file with this application
